# Fourierx

Developed a comprehensive signal processing toolkit implementing FFT-based analysis across
multiple domains: (1) Audio classification using CNN architectures on spectral representations, (2)
Time-series forecasting through frequency decomposition and pattern detection, and (3) EEG
brain wave analysis for cognitive state classification
