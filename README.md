# Fourierx

**Developed a comprehensive signal processing toolkit implementing FFT-based analysis across
multiple domains:** <br>
(1) Audio classification using CNN architectures on spectral representations, <br>
(2) Time-series forecasting through frequency decomposition and pattern detection, and <br>
(3) EEG brain wave analysis for cognitive state classification, the dataset used for this from the website https://www.bbci.de/competition/ii/ (Dataset II a) <br>
NOTE: it was not done for the competetion but to explore the EEG signals
